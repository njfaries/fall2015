Technical Practice: Analysis and Design

Engineers usually follow a standard proceedure both for the sake of the company and also for the sake of reassuring the client.
After an agreement is signed, a work plan is prepared by the engineer and signed off by the client.  This includes
-Scope of project -- important to define.
-Statemnet of work -- who is going to do what
-Work breakdown structure -- some kind of division of the work into different tasks. What are inputs to the task?  What is the task deliverable?  The deliverable needs a date, which is tied to a schedule.
-Project team
-Resources -- Human resources, technological resources, hardware/software..etc.
-Person-hour and cost estimates -- if a fixed price, not totally necessary.
-Description of deliverables -- manage the expectations of the client.  Don't under-deliver, but make sure to be clear about what will be delivered
-Project schedule -- Usually a Gantt chart. Sometimes Excel
-Approvals section -- Where people sign off, approve revisions, etc.

Problem analysis:
-Problem statement -- there must be some problem because you are doing work.  Includes project goals and constraints, performance specifications
--Project objectives 
--Data gathering -- Things like market studies, competitors' products, regulations
--Assumptions -- need to be laid out clearly and communicated to the client.
-Potential solutions
--Analysis of potential approaches
--Selection of best solution approach
-Conclusion and recommendations

After analysis, design is key as it leads to deliverables

Each design project starts with two questions:
-Is there really a problem?
-If so, whose problem is it?
